                <br><br>"The Golden Octopus" is a game that I made as the final project in my computer graphics course.<br><br>
                The specifications for this assignment were to create something cool using OpenGL. I decided to program a game where there is one golden octopus among several silver ones. The golden one turns silver and they all jump around and over each other. The goal is to keep track of which one was silver, and they get revealed at the end. Here is a video of the program running:

                <br><br>The website "TaHaw" was the main project in my Web Development class.<br><br>I worked in a group and together we made a site with two games, named "Ta" and "Haw". The games are very simple and were more just to test our web development abilities. In Taw, the goal of the game is to click a button in the middle of the screen as many times as possible in the given time limit. In Haw, the goal is to hold the button down as long as possible. The games can be accessed by clicking on the play button for whichever game you want to play. The leaderboards are displayed on the main page, although they do get periodically wiped. Here is a link to the website:

                This program was the main project in my Operating Systems 1 class.<br><br>
                The goal of this assignment was to create a simplified but functional version of a shell in linux using the C programming language. In the example picutre I took here, I ran several commands on this shell including "echo", "cat", "ls", "vim", "g++" to compile the simple c++ program I wrote to test vim, and running the program with "./hello". The program also supports input/output redirection as seen in the line "echo "Hello World!" > test.txt".
